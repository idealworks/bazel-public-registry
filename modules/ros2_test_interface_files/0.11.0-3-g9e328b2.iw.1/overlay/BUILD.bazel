# NOTE: Even though this is technically a "package", what ros2_rcl_interfaces does
#       is just grab files from here and include it as if it's part of the package:
#
#       https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/commit/dc0fbaee6a1b8fbc139e1ba266beee52f95380ac
#
#       We have to support this by just exporting the action/msg/srv files directly
#       as filegroups.
